# Team_phylo
This github includes data and code to create phylogenetic trees from publically available E. coli data. 
With this code you can calculate cluster sizes, which helps determine de novo evolution and transmission 
in antibiotic resistance. The folder also includes code that creates a heatmap with p-values.
